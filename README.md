# SPRA VOD, Surface Roughness, and Soil Moisture Results 
This repository has results of the Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD), surface roughness parameter, and soil moisture obtained from the Simultaneous Parameter Retrieval Algorithm (SPRA), which is applied to the X-band AMSR-E brightness temperature observations. The data corresponds to the manuscript submitted for possible publication at Water Resources Research (WRR).
Most of the outputs are saved in MATLAB's mat file format. All the necessary variables required to reproduct a particular plot are provided in the mat files.
